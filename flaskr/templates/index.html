      <p id="introduction"> Many users are concerned about the covid. Therefore, to restrict the number of people in the gym, members of our gym must schedule an appointment with a specific section of the gym. In addition, our application places emphasis on the communication between our coach and user, users can share feed/post and follow other users. Moreover, our gym welcomes sharing and learning, every user can be a coach and every coach can hold an event in our classroom.</p>
